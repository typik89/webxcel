This project was forked from https://github.com/michaelneu/webxcel.git and was adapted for my tasks

Webxcel creates a full-fledged RESTful web backend from your Microsoft Excel workbooks. 
It is written in 100% plain Visual Basic macros and comes with a lot of handy tools to help you build the next big thing.

I removed some functionality from the parent project e.g. primary and foreign keys to simplify work with tables.
And I changed an algorithm working of HttpServer because parent project's HttpServer doesn't allow use Formulas.
